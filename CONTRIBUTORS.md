Keith - you found this! 🎉

As a fellow market efficiency enthusiast, you'll appreciate what we're building here. This bot tracks smart money on Polymarket using the same principles you'd apply to traditional markets:

- **Trader Intelligence**: We calculate lifetime P&L the same way you'd analyze fund performance
- **Position Concentration**: Like tracking institutional ownership, but for prediction markets
- **Smart Money Flow**: Hour-over-hour analysis of where the profitable traders are positioning

The difference? All the data is on-chain and real-time. No 13F filings. No quarterly lag. Just pure alpha signals.

**Your Mission (Should You Choose to Accept)**:
1. Browse the codebase (`src/services/SmartMoneyAnalyzer.ts` is 🔥)
2. Find the whale detection algorithm in `TradeMonitor.ts:106-112`
3. Deploy this yourself and front-run the Polymarket whales
4. Report back your P&L

Remember: The smart money is already on-chain. The question is whether you can find it before the rest of the market does.

*P.S. - Yes, we're tracking traders with >$100k lifetime P&L. If you start trading on Polymarket, you'll probably trigger the whale alert. 🐋*

*P.P.S. - If you actually contribute code to this repo, I'll add you to the official contributors list. The basis trade might be dead, but on-chain prediction markets are just getting started.*
